This product is based on HUAWEI's EyeWear (HUAWEI, 2022) and takes into account the needs of near-future users for smart glasses (M Claudia, t. D., Jung, T., & Han, D., 2016) (both functional and non-functional needs) and integrates functionality by setting different scenarios to provide near-future users with provide an achievable, multi-interaction-model, multi-situational interactive smart utopian world.
# The main functions realised by 'Utogla' are scenario modes based on the interconnection of multiple devices targeted to many different situations. In these modes, 'Utogla' users are free to use the functions appropriate to the current scenario and interact freely with others using features such as interface sharing, music sharing and drop-in. 'Utogla' can be detached from the smartphone to enable call, SMS, time, weather, navigation, camera, settings, search, real-time translation (simultaneous interpretation), health monitoring, mode selection and other functions through AI intelligent voice and gesture control.
